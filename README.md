This is a project for my full stack development carrer at CoderHouse, based on a burger shop in my neighborhood. 
The carrer is composed of the next four courses, where I learned and implemented those technologies.

- Bootstrap
- Responsive
- SASS
- SEO and [Hosting](https://jack-and-jek.000webhostapp.com/)

## 2) JavaScript (FINISHED)

I developed theese functionalities:
- Script for the hero carousel, which controls swiping right and left.
- Orders page cart frontend functionality. 
- SPA script which routes the pages and run the corresponding scripts.
- API to handle the orders POST request to a JSON, simulating a DB.

I learned and implemented:
- Basic sintax (variables, functions, objects, arrays, etc)
- Storage and JSON
- DOM
- Events
- Selectors
- JQuery selectors, effects and animations.

## 3) React JS (CURRENTLY STUDYING)

I'm working on a books eCommerce for this course and I'm trying to build a chat for practising in parallel. 

For this project (Jack and Jek), when I finish this course, I'm going to implement all I will have learned and transform this web to a react App.
