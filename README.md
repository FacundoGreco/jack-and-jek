## Description

This is a project for my web development course, based on a burger shop in my neighborhood. 

At this moment, I'm finishing the first course about frontend. I learned and implemented:

- Wireframe design
- HTML and CSS
- Transformations and animations
- Git and GitHub
- Bootstrap
- Responsive
- SASS
- SEO and [Hosting](https://jack-and-jek.000webhostapp.com/)

I also developed two scripts (one for the hero carousel, and another for the order form) with JavaScript, but we will learn that language soon with the second course.
